# Agent Self-Watch Phase Policy (cmd_107)

This is a specification for `inbox_watcher.sh`'s behavior, not an
instruction agents need to read. It documents the phase flags and
read-cost controls the watcher implements.

Phase migration is controlled by watcher flags:

- **Phase 1 (baseline)**: `process_unread_once` at startup + `inotifywait` event-driven loop + timeout fallback.
- **Phase 2 (normal nudge off)**: `disable_normal_nudge` behavior enabled (`ASW_DISABLE_NORMAL_NUDGE=1` or `ASW_PHASE>=2`).
- **Phase 3 (final escalation only)**: `FINAL_ESCALATION_ONLY=1` (or `ASW_PHASE>=3`) so normal `send-keys inboxN` is suppressed; escalation lane remains for recovery.

Read-cost controls:

- `summary-first` routing: unread_count fast-path before full inbox parsing.
- `no_idle_full_read`: timeout cycle with unread=0 must skip heavy read path.
- Metrics hooks are recorded: `unread_latency_sec`, `read_count`, `estimated_tokens`.

**Escalation** (when nudge is not processed):

| Elapsed | Action | Trigger |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 0〜2 min | Standard pty nudge | Normal delivery |
| 2〜4 min | Escape×2 + nudge | Copilot/Kimi use Escape×2 + Ctrl-C + nudge. Claude/Codex/OpenCode use a plain nudge instead |
| 4 min+ | Context reset sent (max once per 5 min, skipped for Codex) | Force session reset + YAML re-read |
